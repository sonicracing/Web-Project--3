    <h1>Communities involved with the Treaty</h1>
    <p>Treaty 5 — also known as the Winnipeg Treaty — was signed in 1875-76 by the federal government, Ojibway peoples,
      and
      the
      Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg. Treaty 5 covers much of present-day central and northern Manitoba, as well as
      portions
      of
      Saskatchewan and Ontario.</p>
