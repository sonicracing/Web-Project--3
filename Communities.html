  <h1>Communities involved with the Treaty</h1>
  <p>Treaty 5 — also known as the Winnipeg Treaty — was signed in 1875–76 by the federal government, Ojibwa peoples, and
    the
    Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg. Treaty 5 covers much of present-day central and northern Manitoba, as well as portions
    of
    Saskatchewan and Ontario.</p>
