  <h1>Communities and Ethnic Affiliation/Nation:</h1>
  <p>
    Treaty 5 encompasses various Indigenous communities, each with its own ethnic affiliation or nation. The treaty
    primarily involves the Cree, Dene, and Oji-Cree peoples, who are part of the larger group of Indigenous nations in
    Canada.
  </p>

  <h1>Differences from Other Treaties:</h1>
  <p>
    Treaty 5 is unique in its geographic coverage and the specific communities involved. It covers a large, sparsely
    populated area in northern Canada. The terms of Treaty 5 are similar to other numbered treaties in Canada, but the
    specific rights and conditions can vary, reflecting the unique circumstances of the communities involved.
  </p>
  <h1>
    Implementation Today:
  </h1>
  <p>
    The implementation of Treaty 5 continues today, and various aspects of the treaty are still relevant. Some key
    points
    about its implementation include:
    <br>
    <b>Urban Reserves:</b> Some First Nations under Treaty 5, like other Indigenous communities in Canada, have
    established
    urban
    reserves in cities. These urban reserves are often used for economic development, housing, and cultural purposes.
    One
    example is the Long Plain First Nation's Madison Reserve in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Economic Development:</b> Many Treaty 5 communities are engaged in economic development initiatives, including
    businesses,
    partnerships, and resource management, to improve the economic well-being of their members and achieve
    self-sufficiency.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Land and Resource Management:</b> Indigenous communities under Treaty 5 retain hunting, fishing, and trapping
    rights on
    their traditional territories. These rights are protected and managed through modern land and resource agreements
    and
    negotiations with the Canadian government.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Education:</b> The legacy of education provisions in Treaty 5 has led to ongoing efforts to improve education
    outcomes
    for
    Indigenous children and address the historical injustices related to the residential school system.
