    Historic Terms of the Treaty:
  </h1>
  <p>
    Treaty 5 was signed between the Canadian government and the Indigenous peoples of northern Manitoba, northwestern
    Ontario, and parts of Saskatchewan. The treaty was negotiated in 1908-1910. Specific details of the treaty vary from
    one community
    to
    another, but some common elements include:<br><br>

    Land: Treaty 5 guaranteed reserves for the signatory First Nations, with each family of five typically receiving a
    specific land allocation.<br><br>
    Annuities: Indigenous individuals were entitled to annual payments from the government.<br><br>
    Hunting and Fishing Rights: Indigenous peoples retained the right to hunt, fish, and trap on their traditional
    territories, even on ceded lands.<br><br>
    Education: The treaty provided for education services, but this aspect has been a source of historical contention
    due to
    the residential school system.
