    Historic Terms of the Treaty:
  </h1>
  <p>
    Treaty 5 was signed between the Canadian government and the Indigenous peoples of northern Manitoba, northwestern
    Ontario, and parts of Saskatchewan. The treaty was negotiated in 1908-1910, and its terms included provisions
    related to
    land, hunting and fishing rights, annuities, and education. Specific details of the treaty vary from one community
    to
    another, but some common elements include:

    Land: Treaty 5 guaranteed reserves for the signatory First Nations, with each family of five typically receiving a
    specific land allocation.
    Annuities: Indigenous individuals were entitled to annual payments from the government.
    Hunting and Fishing Rights: Indigenous peoples retained the right to hunt, fish, and trap on their traditional
    territories, even on ceded lands.
    Education: The treaty provided for education services, but this aspect has been a source of historical contention
    due to
    the residential school system.
