    Historic Terms of the Treaty:
  </h1>
  <!-- what the agreement was about -->
  <p>
    Land: Treaty 5 guaranteed reserves for the signatory First Nations, with each family of five typically receiving a
    160 acre land allocation.<br><br>
    Annuities: Indigenous individuals were entitled to annual payments of $5 a year from the government.<br><br>
    Hunting and Fishing Rights: Indigenous peoples retained the right to hunt, fish, and trap on their traditional
    territories, even on ceded lands.<br><br>
    Education: The treaty provided for education services, but this aspect has been a source of historical contention
    due to
    the residential school system.
  </p>
  <h1>How is Treaty 5 different</h1>
  <p>The treaty is different because instead of dealing with a large area at oen time, the band commisioner went to each
    regional band and did it that way.
