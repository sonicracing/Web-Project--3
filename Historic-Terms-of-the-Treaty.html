  <!-- what the agreement was about -->
  <div class="push-in">
    <p>
      Land: Treaty 5 guaranteed reserves for the signatory First Nations, with each family of five typically receiving a
      <span class="bold">160 acre land allocation.</span><br><br>
      Annuities: Indigenous individuals were entitled to annual payments of <span class="bold">$5 a year</span> from the
      government.<br><br>
      Hunting and Fishing Rights: Indigenous peoples retained the <span class="bold">right to hunt, fish, and
        trap</span> on their traditional
      territories.<br><br>
      Education: The treaty provided for education services, but this aspect has been a source of historical contention
      due to
      the <span class="bold">residential school system.</span>
    </p>
    <h1>How is Treaty 5 different</h1>
    <p class="push-left">The treaty is different because instead of dealing with a large area at one time, the band
      commisioner went to
      each
      regional band and did it that way.
